# Working with ES6 & Node.js: Professional README Generator
## Description

In this challenge I created a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) package, the application is built in node.js and uses ES6 sintax.

Clone the repo to your machine and open a terminal of your choice navigate to the root of the newly cloned folder and run `npm install` in the terminal. You are all set now to run the program.

## Usage
After the installation instructions, in the terminal, run `node index.js`, you will prompted with some question to answer, your answers will be the content of the readme.md.
At the end of the program, your file will be generated in the `generated-files` folder.
